# üîê Self-Signed SSL Certificate Automation Script

This project provides a **fully automated Bash script** to create a complete **TLS Certificate Authority (CA) hierarchy** with:
- A **Root CA** (`AcmeRootCA`)
- A **Subordinate CA** (`AcmeCA`)
- A **server certificate** for a domain (e.g., `www.verysecureserver.com`)

It also configures:
- **XAMPP Web Server**
- **BIND DNS**
- **Firewall rules (UFW)**
- **Trust setup in Firefox**
- **A simple secure file upload page over HTTPS**

## üìå Project Context

This script was created as part of a security mini-project for a university course. The project involves building a secure web infrastructure with a custom certificate authority, private server certificates, DNS configuration, and HTTPS hosting.

> ‚úÖ This project aligns with the requirements outlined in GENIBARTA tutorial videos and EWU‚Äôs course deliverables.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 18.04+ (Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04)
- Sudo/root privileges
- Internet connection (to install packages & XAMPP)
- Optional: Firefox (for CA trust import)

## üöÄ How to Run

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository:
    git clone https://github.com/saifkhancse/Self-Signed-SSL-Certificate-Script.git
    cd Self-Signed-SSL-Certificate-Script

2Ô∏è‚É£ Make the Script Executable:
    chmod +x Self-Signed-SSL-Certificate-Script.sh

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script with Root Privileges:
    sudo ./Self-Signed-SSL-Certificate-Script.sh

4Ô∏è‚É£ Follow Prompts:
    - Your domain (e.g., www.verysecureserver.com)
    - Organization, country, city, email (used in certificate subject)

---

## üîç Verification

- Open Firefox and visit: https://www.verysecureserver.com
  ‚úÖ You should see a green padlock (trusted connection).

- Use the upload form: https://www.verysecureserver.com/upload.php

- Verify DNS:
    ping www.verysecureserver.com

- Optionally inspect traffic with Wireshark on another machine.
